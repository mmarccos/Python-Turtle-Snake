# Python-Turtle-Snake
Python Snake Game, first project finished on 12/2020.

For a high school project around 12/2020, I was required to create a simple game using the Turtle module in Python.
I decided to make snake, since I thought it would of been easy.
It ended up taking a lot of time to complete, but fortunately finished on time.
The code attached was the exact code turned in, no modifications to make it better.
